class MathHelper:
    """
    Helper class for performing mathematical operations related to game development.

    This class provides static methods for common mathematical calculations used in games,
    such as distance calculation, clamping values, and linear interpolation (lerp), among others.

    Attributes:
        PI (float): The mathematical constant Pi.
        E (float): The mathematical constant Euler's number.

    Methods:
        add(a, b): Return the sum of a and b.
        subtract(a, b): Return the difference of a and b.
        multiply(a, b): Return the product of a and b.
        divide(a, b): Return the division of a by b. Raises ValueError if b is zero.
        power(base, exponent): Return the base raised to the power of exponent.
        sqrt(value): Return the square root of the value. Raises ValueError for negative numbers.
        distance(x1, y1, x2, y2): Calculate the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
        clamp(value, min_value, max_value): Clamp a value between a minimum and maximum value.
        lerp(start, end, t): Perform linear interpolation between start and end by t.
